Description: Firmware for USB JTAG programmers.
 .
 This firmware allows a USB-capable microcontroller - currently that's
 primarily the Cypress FX2 EZ-USB family, or an FTDI FT245 in combination with
 a CPLD - to act like an Altera USB-Blaster JTAG pod, which in turn may allow
 you to use tools you'd normally use with the Altera USB-Blaster, including
 available Linux tools such as UrJTAG.
